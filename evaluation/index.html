  <h1>Free Software Foundation</h1>
  <h2>
      <b>Mission Statement:</b>
      "<span style="font-weight:normal">The Free Software Foundation (FSF) is a nonprofit with a worldwide mission to promote computer user freedom. We defend the rights of all software users."</span></h3>
  <p>As per the statement above, the FSF's primary primary objective has always been to protect the rights of computer users.
  The way that we have always gone about this is by promoting the usage of free software (software that "users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve" as we define it) and it's development.
  In recent years, the campaigns that we have been working hardest with are: <ul>
      <li>Fight to Repair, the FSF's support for right to repair, which aims to ensure that end users will always be able to repair and replace parts in their devices as neccessary</li>
      <!-- <li>Secure and Open Boot</li> -->
      <li>The GNU Operating system, a freedom respecting operating system to offer a replacement for Microsoft's Windows or Apple's OSX</li>
      <li>End Software Patents, which creates a way for developers to distribute and license their work while ensuring that it will always remain open and free</li>
  </ul>
  And as such, the FSF will be evaluated based on the success of each of these campaigns, and how they manage to protect and promote computer user freedom.</p>
